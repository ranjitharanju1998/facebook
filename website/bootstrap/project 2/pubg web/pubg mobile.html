                    <P class="para1">The AWM is a powerful bolt action rifle designed for extreme range sharpshooting.
                         Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in the game, it is also one 
                         of only two ranged weapons (the other being the crossbow) capable of killing any
                          player in one shot to the head, even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet.
                           At distances beyond 500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill
                            players in one shot to the head. The long reload, time between shots, high damage
                             and unique ammo all represent the high risk, high reward gameplay that requires
                              the user to have patience and a steady aim, moving position quickly 
                              after firing, lest other players recognizing the firing sound
                               of the AWM attempt to close in to take the weapon for themselves.</P>
